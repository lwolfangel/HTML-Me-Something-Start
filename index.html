            <h2>Saint Louis, MO</h2>
            <p>
               I was born and raised in Saint Louis, MO. 
               My parents,also, both grew up here. While my dad's parents grew up in St. Louis,
               my mom's came from small towns in Iowa.
               Growing up I always wanted to leave here and live in different cities.

            <h2>Murfreesboro, TN</h2>
            <p>  
               I moved to Murfreesboro, a town about 30 miles southeast of Nashville, when i was 20.
               I began at Middle Tennessee State University in January of 2014. 
               My cousin had transferred there as well, with her entire family moving their the year after. 
               I ended up staying there for 3 years or so, and still visit frequently.

            <h2>West Hollywood, CA</h2>
            <p> 
               I moved to West Hollywood, California in the summer of 2017. 
               My cousin had moved there about a year before, so we ended up being roomates again.
               Los Angeles is definitely not your average city, I can't say it was my favorite city, but not my least either.
               I was fortunate to do a lot of traveling while in LA, but I only ended up staying there for a year.

            <h2>Saint Louis...Again</h2>
            <p>
               I ended up moving back home to Saint Louis after LA and i've been here ever since. 
               It's really nice to be home near family and watch my nieces and nephews grow up.
               I'm not sure if I'll move again, but I definitely will always love to travel and see new places.

            <h2>Special Mention: Iowa</h2>
            <p>
               Iowa, specifically my great-grandparents' farm, was like a home away from home for the first ten years of my life. 
               We would spend weeks during the summer there, spring breaks, and most holidays. 
               It will always be an important place in my heart, 
               because of not only the memories but the symbolism of family as it passed from generation to generation.
               Unfortunately, they sold the farm about 20 years ago and it's no longer in the family.
